Description: Shiny base package comes with a handful set of UI widgets, but often we need to build a little more complex UI based on these base UI components. For example, a file uploader, with options to specify file separater and a previewing window. We build this package to make these commonly used UI components available so you get more time writing the criticl part of you Shiny application.
